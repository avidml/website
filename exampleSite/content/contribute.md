AVID is a community-driven effort, involving volunteer engineers, hackers, and researchers. The easiest way to be involved in AVID is to [join our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FcXYZzmv3T). We follow the [AI Village Code of Conduct](https://aivillage.org/conduct/) in this server.

We're just getting started, so if you're interested in contributing to specific areas, let us know! Here are a few examples:

- Taxonomy development
- Evaluation rubrics development
- Bug bounties and/or AI Vulnerability research
- Evaluation areas, e.g. fairness, explainability, privacy, security
- Evaluation domains, e.g. NLP, CV, multimodal models
- We are also looking for board members who are going to shape, lead, and execute on our strategic efforts: including but not limited to the above.

If you'd like to be involved in an effort and/or want to contribute in a certain capacity (board member, team lead) use the Volunteer Form below to reach out, and we'll get back to you shortly.
