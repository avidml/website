AVID is a community-driven effort, involving volunteer engineers, hackers, and researchers like you! Here are a few examples you can contribute.

## Contribute a Report
Please use the Vulnerability Reporting Form to report an AI failure mode in the wild. The AVID team will review and integrate this report---with proper attribution to you---into a new or existing vulnerability in AVID.

## Improvements
- Taxonomy development

If you'd like to be involved in an effort and/or want to contribute in a certain capacity (board member, team lead) use the Interest Form below to reach out, and we'll get back to you shortly.

## AI Vulnerability Research
- Evaluation tooling development
- Evaluation areas, e.g. fairness, explainability, privacy, security
- Evaluation domains, e.g. NLP, CV, multimodal models
- AI bug bounties and vulnerability research
- We are also looking for officers to shape, lead, and execute on our strategic efforts: including but not limited to the above.

The easiest way to be involved in AVID is to [join our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FcXYZzmv3T). We follow the [AI Village Code of Conduct](https://aivillage.org/conduct/) in this server.
