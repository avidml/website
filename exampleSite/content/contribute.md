AVID is a community-driven effort, involving volunteer engineers, hackers, and researchers like you! The easiest way to be involved in AVID is to [join our discord server](https://discord.com/invite/FcXYZzmv3T). We follow the [AI Village Code of Conduct](https://aivillage.org/conduct/) in this server.

Also, here are a few specific ways you can support our work.

## Submit a Report
You can use our Vulnerability Reporting Form to report an AI failure mode in the wild. The AVID team will review and integrate this report---with proper attribution to you---into a new or existing vulnerability in AVID.

You can also open a pull pequest to directly add a report or vulnerability to our [GitHub](https://github.com/avidml/avid-db).

We welcome comments, feedback, and inputs for our taxonomy and database structure. Please [e-mail](mailto:avid.mldb@gmail.com) us with your comments and we'll get back to you!

## Research Collaborations
Our ongoing and planned research areas include but are note limited to

- Audits of open-source AI models and datasets
- Evaluation tooling specific to an area (e.g. fairness, privacy, security) or domain (e.g. NLP, CV, multimodal models)
- AI vulnerability research

If you're interested in collaborating with us, please say hi in our discord, send us an e-mail, or fill out the Interest Form below.
