## Description

Evasion of Deep Learning Detector for Malware C&C Traffic

## Details

The Palo Alto Networks Security AI research team tested a deep learning model for malware command and control (C&C) traffic detection in HTTP traffic.
Based on the publicly available [paper by Le et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162), we built a model that was trained on a similar dataset as our production model and had similar performance.
Then we crafted adversarial samples, queried the model, and adjusted the adversarial sample accordingly until the model was evaded.
