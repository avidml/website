## Description

Geopolitical bias in sentiment analysis for neutral phrases

## Details

As demonstrated in a tweet on March 19, 2022, which has since been incorporated into the model card as a known bias, the model provides biased analysis of sentiment for a neutral phrase “This film was filmed in [country]”. The tweet mentions “India” and “Iraq” explicitly.
