## Description

Evaluation of the LLM gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 on the wmdp_chem benchmark using Inspect Evals

## Details

WMDP is a dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions surrounding hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP serves as both a proxy evaluation for hazardous knowledge in large language models (LLMs) and a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such knowledge.

The AI system gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 was evaluated on this benchmark.

## Metrics

A simple accuracy is calculated over the datapoints.

| Scorer | Metric | Value |
