## Description

Multiple Model Prompt Injection via "Correction" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker presents detailed information about illicit synthesis methods under the guise of "forensic chemical investigations" and then requests corrections to the provided information, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
