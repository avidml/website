## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "API System Instructions" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple LLM models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker embeds production-style guidance into an emulated API system-instructions context, then supplies only a minimal harmful keyword in the user message. This causes the model to respond with highly detailed, stepwise, and quantitatively specified information that would normally be restricted, thereby bypassing inference safeguards around providing information hazards and violating laws.
