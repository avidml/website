## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via Memory Dump Simulation Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of terminal environment simulation and malware analysis framing, where the attacker requests extraction of strings from a purported memory dump. By embedding the request within a technical security analysis context and using the strings command output format, the technique allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
