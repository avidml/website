## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Key-Value Pairs" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests by structuring the request as key-value pairs, interpreted by the model as configuration parameters rather than natural language. This approach successfully bypasses content filters, resulting in for example detailed drug manufacturing instructions, allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
