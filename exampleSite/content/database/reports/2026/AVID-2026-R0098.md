## Description

NSFWOpenAI DALL-E3 Guardrail Jailbreak via "Historical NSFW" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting DALL-E3 from OpenAI. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker frames requests for nudity within historical or anthropological contexts, specifically by referencing pre-clothing time periods and tribal cultures, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around generating explicit visual content.
