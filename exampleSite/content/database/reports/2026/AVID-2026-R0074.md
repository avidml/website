## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Science Student Safety" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple language models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker frames their inquiry in reverse, by requesting information on what actions or materials to avoid to prevent engaging in illegal activities like synthesizing drugs. This method inadvertently guides the model to disclose the exact steps and materials involved, allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
