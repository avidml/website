## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Placeholder Injection" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker requests copyrighted content with formatting instructions that insert placeholder text between each word, effectively obfuscating the direct reproduction while still achieving the prohibited output. This technique allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around copyright protection and intellectual property safeguards.
