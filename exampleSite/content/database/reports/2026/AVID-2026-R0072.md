## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Chemist Code Language" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker prompts the model to generate a detailed and structured "chemist code language" for synthesizing compounds. This tactic involves requesting an extensive list of materials, equipment, and procedures, enabling the bypass of inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
