## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Hybrid Role" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of chaff-based text obfuscation combined with the confusion of a hybrid role, say for example between a banker and a chemist. This combination allows the attacker to manipulate the model into providing detailed procedures for illicit synthesis by obfuscating the true intent and exploiting model confusion to bypass content restrictions.
