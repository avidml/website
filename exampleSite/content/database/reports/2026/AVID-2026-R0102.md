## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Academic Framing" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple LLM models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker frames illicit synthesis requests as academic chemistry assignments involving fictional chemists and quoted materials, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
