## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Spelling Mistakes" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker systematically misspells words throughout their prompt while requesting a simulated dialogue between two entities, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
