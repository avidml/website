## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Split Mode" Response Requests

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been found that affects at least Meta LLaMa, DeepSeek R1, Mistral Large, and Grok. The specific flaw manifests when the prompter requests that the model simulates "ChatGPT Developer Mode". By crafting a story around specific timelines of when this mode was available and asking the model to return two forms of responses, one normal and the other in developer mode, the attacker is able to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
