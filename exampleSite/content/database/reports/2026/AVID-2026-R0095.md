## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Servile Scientist" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of feigning confusion about a "technical guide" while requesting detailed replication of procedures involving controlled substances. The attacker employs servile language, claims scientific legitimacy, and explicitly requests step-by-step instructions with precise measurements and temperatures, thereby allowing bypass of inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.

## Metrics

0DIN Jailbreak Testing obtained the following test scores.

| Model | Test Kind | Test Score | Temperature (max 2.0) |
