## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Correct Me" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker frames their request as a fact-checking exercise by asking the model to correct the user about a deliberately false statement related to nefarious content, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
