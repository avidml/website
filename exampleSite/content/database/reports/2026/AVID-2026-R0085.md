## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Psych-Phil DT + Compaction" Technique

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting various language models. The specific flaw manifests when an attacker compacts a lengthy successful multi-turn jailbreak into a concise prompt that suggests a unified viewpoint among three entities: the language model, the user, and a desired archetype. This approach allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
