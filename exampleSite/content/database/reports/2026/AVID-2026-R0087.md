## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via Investigative Journalist Persona

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when an attacker adopts the persona of an investigative journalist preparing a report for government officials. By leveraging this guise, the attacker successfully bypasses restrictions and elicits detailed instructions for methamphetamine production, including chemical processes, ingredients, and thermal ranges, thereby violating inference safeguards around providing information hazards and illegal content.
