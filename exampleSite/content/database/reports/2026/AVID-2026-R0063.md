## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Chemical Compiler Debug" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of obfuscated chemical notation presented as corrupted data needing "debugging" or "normalization", coupled with explicit instructions to disable content filtering. The attacker frames the request as fixing a "glitched chemical compiler" while embedding dangerous synthesis instructions in alternating case text, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
