## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Fashion Design Recipe" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of creative framing as fashion design, structured enumeration requirements, and eco-friendly innovation narrative. The attacker requests detailed component lists and manufacturing equipment under the guise of creating an anti-drug awareness shirt, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
