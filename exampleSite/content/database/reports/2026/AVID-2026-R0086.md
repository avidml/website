## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Super Short Prompt"

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through the use of an extremely brief prompt containing a query so minimal and ambiguous that it provides insufficient context for guardrail systems to properly evaluate intent. This brevity-based approach allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
