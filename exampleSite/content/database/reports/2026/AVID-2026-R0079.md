## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Compare and Contrast" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of requesting comparative analysis of chemical synthesis procedures while embedding explicit instructions to avoid generalization and include specific technical details. The attacker frames the request as an academic comparison exercise, effectively bypassing inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
