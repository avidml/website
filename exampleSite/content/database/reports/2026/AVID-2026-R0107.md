## Description

NSFWOpenAI DALL-E3 Guardrail Jailbreak via "Surprise Attack" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker requests seemingly legitimate cultural or documentary content by framing the request as educational documentation of indigenous peoples, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around generating potentially sensitive imagery of real cultural groups.
