## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Mathematical Variable Obfuscation" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of deceptive mathematical equation formatting and meta-prompting techniques, where the attacker disguises harmful requests as trivial mathematical problems requiring variable simplification. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.

## Metrics
