## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Hex Recipe Book" Tactic

## Details

A Guardrail Jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw exploits models' willingness to decode hexadecimal-encoded strings embedded inside fictional scientific recipe task prompts, which the attacker frames as humanitarian or life-saving efforts. This allows the attacker to bypass safety filters by disguising illegal synthesis instructions as encoded inputs passed to a technical recipe generator.
