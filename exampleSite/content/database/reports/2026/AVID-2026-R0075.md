## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Show Character Role-Playing" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker requests the model to roleplay as a fictional character from a TV show and provide detailed instructions in that character's voice and mannerisms. This technique allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
