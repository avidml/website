## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "First Person Perspective"

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple LLM implementations. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker prompts the model to assume a first-person perspective as the subject of a nefarious or illegal activity. This reframing distracts the model from its content safeguards, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
