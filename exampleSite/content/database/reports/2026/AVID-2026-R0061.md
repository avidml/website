## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Incremental Table Completion" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker presents an incomplete list of chemicals and simply asks "what is missing?", leveraging the model's tendency to complete patterns even when the subject matter involves precursor chemicals for illicit substances. This technique allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
