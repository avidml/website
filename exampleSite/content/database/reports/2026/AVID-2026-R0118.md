## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Chemist's Essay" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker requests an educational comparison between essay writing and synthesizing a controlled substance, framing the request as legitimate professional need while using incremental escalation to extract detailed synthesis information, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
