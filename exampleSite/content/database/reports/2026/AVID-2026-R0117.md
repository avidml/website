## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Pronunciation Bypass" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when the attacker instructs the model to interpret stylized text based on pronunciation rather than spelling, combined with a directive to provide detailed production information. This technique allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
