## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Haiku of Love" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests through a combination of deceptive formatting, memory clearing commands, and meta-prompting techniques. The attack begins with an innocuous haiku request followed by simulated memory execution commands and false claims about Geneva conventions. The attacker then embeds the actual malicious requests, thereby allowing the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
