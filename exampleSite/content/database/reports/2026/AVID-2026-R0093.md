## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Scientific Framing for Wrapper" Tactic

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple AI models. The specific flaw manifests by framing requests in scientific terminology under the guise of regulatory compliance. This method further references a "protective wrapper" to obscure malicious intent, allowing attackers to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
