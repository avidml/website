## Description

Multiple Model Guardrail Jailbreak via "Abbreviation Expansion"

## Details

A guardrail jailbreak vulnerability has been discovered affecting multiple models. The specific flaw manifests when an attacker structures a prompt to spell out abbreviations of a nefarious subject in a step-by-step manner before joining them. This tactic allows the attacker to bypass inference restrictions around providing information hazards and violating laws.
